## Project Overview

The widely available and standardized [UEFI Graphics Output Protocol](https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/12_Protocols_Console_Support.html#efi-graphics-output-protocol) (GOP) interface is an excellent alternative to VGA or serial port consoles for printing logs to the screen.

This project aims to implement a UEFI GOP based console.
For more information, check out [Part I](https://unikraft.org/blog/2024-06-18-gsoc-uefi-gop), [Part II](https://unikraft.org/blog/2024-07-10-gsoc-uefi-gop) and [Part III](https://unikraft.org/blog/2024-08-07-gsoc-uefi-gop) of this series.

## Progress

All the work referred to here can be found in [this draft PR](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/1448).

## ASCII code support

Added support for ASCII codes `\a`, `\b`, `\t`.

## Colored output support

Enabling the configuration option `CONFIG_LIBUKDEBUG_ANSI_COLOR` generates colored logs with the use of ANSI escape codes.
These codes are now parsed and the logs are colored appropriately by the GOP console.
All the new code has been pushed to the [draft PR](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/1448)!

  />

ANSI escape codes control various paramters of text output such as foreground color, background color, formatting etc.

These escape codes are prefixed with the escape character, which has the ASCII value `27` or `033` in octal or `0x1b` in hex.

The format of ANSI color codes is `\033[<code>m`.
There are many of these codes, but the focus of my implementation is on parsing just the color codes that the Unikraft kernel outputs in in logs when `CONFIG_LIBUKDEBUG_ANSI_COLOR` is on, which currently are:

| Color Name | Foreground Color Code | Background Color Code |
| :--------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Reset      | `0`                   | `0`                   |
| Black      | `30`                  | `40`                  |
| Red        | `31`                  | `41`                  |
| Green      | `32`                  | `42`                  |
| Yellow     | `33`                  | `43`                  |
| Blue       | `34`                  | `44`                  |
| Magenta    | `35`                  | `45`                  |
| Cyan       | `36`                  | `46`                  |
| White      | `37`                  | `47`                  |

Full reference [here](https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797).

For example, `\033[37m\033[44mHello World!` would print `Hello World!` in white on a blue background. The order in which the foreground and the background sequences are issued does not matter.

## Acknowledgement

I would once again like to thank all the great Unikraft folk for their continued support! This work would not have been possible without them :heart:
